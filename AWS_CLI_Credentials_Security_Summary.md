# Securing AWS CLI Credentials on a Shared Computer

When using a shared computer to upload files to AWS S3, itâ€™s important to protect AWS credentials from unauthorized access or deletion. Here are several methods to enhance security:

## 1. Restrict File Permissions
Use Windows file permissions on the `credentials` and `config` files to restrict access. Set **Read & Execute** permissions for users who need to use the profile but shouldn't modify or delete it.

**Steps:**
- Navigate to `%USERPROFILE%\.aws`.
- Right-click the `credentials` file, select **Properties**, then go to the **Security** tab.
- Adjust permissions to allow only authorized users to modify the file.
- Repeat for the `config` file if needed.

## 2. Use Temporary Environment Variables
Instead of storing permanent credentials, each user can set AWS credentials as environment variables temporarily for their session.

**Example Commands:**
```cmd
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
```
After uploading files, users can clear the variables:
```cmd
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

## 3. Use AWS SSO or IAM Role with Temporary Credentials
For higher security, consider using AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) or IAM roles with `aws sts assume-role` for temporary credentials. This eliminates the need for long-term access keys on the shared machine.

- **AWS SSO**: Users authenticate via a web portal, receiving temporary credentials without storing them.
- **IAM Assume Role**: Users obtain temporary credentials via a command, reducing credential exposure.

## 4. Automate Credential Management
Use a script that prompts users for credentials, uses them temporarily, and then deletes or rotates them after the session. This ensures that credentials are not left accessible to subsequent users.

These methods help secure AWS CLI credentials in a shared environment, with options to prevent unauthorized modification and protect sensitive information.
