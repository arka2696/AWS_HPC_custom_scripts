    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AWS EC2 Instance Setup:**\n",
    "   - An Ubuntu EC2 instance running on AWS.\n",
    "   - The necessary security group rules to allow SSH and Jupyter Notebook access (typically ports 22 for SSH and 8888 for Jupyter).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Machine Setup:**\n",
    "   - Visual Studio Code installed.\n",
    "   - Python and Jupyter installed locally.\n",

    "### 1. Set Up the EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connect to the EC2 instance:**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns\n",
    "   Example- ssh -i 'C:/Users/nqg26/Downloads/ssh_VSC.pem' ubuntu@ec2-54-161-7-94.compute-1.amazonaws.com",

    "### 3. Connect to Jupyter Notebook in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install the Jupyter Extension in VS Code:**\n",
    "   - Open VS Code.\n",
    "   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.\n",
    "   - Search for \"Jupyter\" and install the extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access the Remote Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - Open VS Code Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.\n",
    "   - Type `Jupyter: Enter the URL of the local running Jupyter server`.\n",
    "   - Enter the URL you got from the Jupyter Notebook running on the EC2 instance (e.g., `http://localhost:8888/?token=your-token`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create and Run Notebooks:**\n",

    "   crontab -e\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Add the following line:\n",

    "\n",
    "To configure the security groups for your AWS EC2 instance to allow access to Jupyter Notebook, you need to add rules to permit traffic on the necessary ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Update Security Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to the AWS Management Console:**\n",
    "   - Log in to your AWS account.\n",
    "   - Open the EC2 Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select Your Instance:**\n",
    "   - In the EC2 Dashboard, click on \"Instances\" in the left-hand menu.\n",
    "   - Select the instance you are using for Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **View Security Groups:**\n",
    "   - In the instance description section at the bottom, find the \"Security groups\" field.\n",
    "   - Click on the security group link to open the security group settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Edit Inbound Rules:**\n",
    "   - In the security group settings, click on the \"Inbound rules\" tab.\n",
    "   - Click the \"Edit inbound rules\" button to modify the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add Rules:**\n",
    "   - Add a rule to allow SSH access:\n",
    "     - Type: `SSH`\n",
    "     - Protocol: `TCP`\n",
    "     - Port Range: `22`\n",
    "     - Source: `Your IP` (recommended) or `0.0.0.0/0` (allows access from any IP address, not recommended for security reasons)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Add a rule to allow Jupyter Notebook access:\n",
    "     - Type: `Custom TCP`\n",
    "     - Protocol: `TCP`\n",
    "     - Port Range: `8888`\n",
    "     - Source: `Your IP` (recommended) or `0.0.0.0/0` (allows access from any IP address, not recommended for security reasons)\n",
    "\n",
    "     **Note:** Using `0.0.0.0/0` allows anyone on the internet to access your Jupyter Notebook, which poses a security risk. It's better to specify your own IP address or a specific range of IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save Rules:**\n",
    "   - After adding the necessary rules, click the \"Save rules\" button.\n"

    "### Example of Updated Security Group Inbound Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rule 1: SSH Access**\n",
    "  - **Type:** SSH\n",
    "  - **Protocol:** TCP\n",
    "  - **Port Range:** 22\n",
    "  - **Source:** Your IP (or `0.0.0.0/0` for wide access, not recommended)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Additional Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limit Access to Specific IPs:** Instead of using `0.0.0.0/0`, you can limit access to specific IP addresses or a range of IP addresses. For example, you can use `203.0.113.0/24` to allow access only from that specific subnet.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Use a VPN or SSH Tunnel:** For additional security, you might consider setting up a VPN or using an SSH tunnel to access Jupyter Notebook without exposing port 8888 directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Establishing an SSH Tunnel (if not using wide-open access)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose not to open port 8888 to the world, you can set up an SSH tunnel to securely connect to Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SSH into your EC2 instance and start Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns\n",
    "   jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set up the SSH tunnel from your local machine:**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem -L 8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "By following these steps, you ensure that your Jupyter Notebook is accessible while maintaining the necessary security.\n"
