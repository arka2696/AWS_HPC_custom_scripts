    "This guide demonstrates how to transfer files from an S3 bucket in one AWS account (source) to another bucket in a different AWS account (destination) using the AWS CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "- **Source Bucket**: `cellprofileraws` in `us-east-1`\n",
    "- **Destination Bucket**: `arkalivr` in `eu-central-1`\n",
    "- **Goal**: Copy all files from `s3://cellprofileraws/Image_data/` to `s3://arkalivr/test/` while ensuring the destination bucket owner has full control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "1. **Configure Permissions**: Ensure the destination bucket allows write access for the source account.\n",
    "2. **Use Recursive Copy**: Use `--recursive` to copy all files from the source directory.\n",
    "3. **Transfer Ownership (Optional)**: Set up **Bucket Owner Enforced** mode on the destination bucket to automatically assign ownership of uploaded files to the destination bucket owner.\n"

    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n",
    "  \"Statement\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n",
    "      \"Principal\": {\n",
    "        \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:root\"\n",

    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with the actual account ID of the source bucket owner **(Insert the account ID of the source bucket, here the source bucket is located in the us-east-1 region)**. This policy will grant permission to upload files from the source account to the destination bucket.\n"
