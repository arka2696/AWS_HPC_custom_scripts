    "   - `format fs=ntfs quick`: Formats the partition as NTFS.\n",

    "- **Disk Number**: Make sure `DISK_NUMBER=1` in the script matches your actual NVMe disk. Adjust it if the number is different.\n",
    "- **Drive Letter**: The drive letter `Z` is assigned; you can modify this to any available letter.\n",
