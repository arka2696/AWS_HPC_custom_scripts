    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to configuring, mounting, and automating the mounting of an Amazon S3 bucket as a mapped drive on a Windows EC2 instance using Rclone. This setup includes installing required components, configuring Rclone, setting up automatic mounting on startup, and troubleshooting common issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Installing Rclone\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the Rclone executable from the [Rclone downloads page](https://rclone.org/downloads/).\n",
    "2. Install or extract it to a known location on your Windows EC2 instance, such as `C:\\rclone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Configuring Rclone with Your S3 Bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Command Prompt** and navigate to the Rclone directory:\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   cd \"C:\\rclone\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Run `rclone config` to start the setup process:\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   rclone config\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Add a new remote**:\n",
    "   - Select `New remote` and name it (e.g., `arkalivr`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Select the storage type**:\n",
    "   - Choose `S3` when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enter AWS credentials**:\n",
    "   - **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** (from your AWS IAM settings).\n",
    "   - **Region**: Set to your S3 bucket’s region (e.g., `eu-central-1`).\n",
    "   - **Endpoint**: Set to the full endpoint URL (`https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`) if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complete the setup** by saving the configuration. After this, Rclone should be configured to connect to your S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Rclone Configuration\n",
    "Your configuration file (`rclone.conf`) should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[arkalivr]\n",
    "type = s3\n",
    "provider = AWS\n",
    "access_key_id = AKIAYRH5M7WBYKJM5A3S\n",
    "secret_access_key = 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\n",
    "region = eu-central-1\n",
    "endpoint = https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\n",
    "location_constraint = eu-central-1\n",
    "acl = private\n",
    "server_side_encryption = aws:kms\n",
    "sse_kms_key_id = arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test the configuration** by listing the contents of the bucket:\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   rclone ls arkalivr:/mybucket\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Replace `arkalivr` with your remote name and `mybucket` with your bucket’s name. If the bucket is empty, you won’t see any output here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Setting Up WinFsp for Rclone Mounting\n",
    "\n",
    "Rclone requires **WinFsp** for mounting on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install WinFsp from the [WinFsp GitHub releases page](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/releases).\n",
    "2. After installation, verify that WinFsp is running by opening Command Prompt and typing:\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   fltmc\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You should see `WinFsp` in the list of drivers if it’s installed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Mounting the S3 Bucket as a Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Command Prompt and run the mount command:\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   rclone mount arkalivr:mybucket X: --vfs-cache-mode full\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Replace `arkalivr` with your remote name and `mybucket` with your bucket’s name.\n",
    "   - `X:` is the drive letter you want to assign.\n",
    "   - `--vfs-cache-mode full` improves performance by caching files locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify the mount**:\n",
    "   - Open **File Explorer** and confirm that `X:` (or your chosen drive letter) appears with the bucket contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Automating the Mount on Startup\n",
    "\n",
    "To have the bucket mount automatically every time the EC2 instance starts, create a batch file and use Task Scheduler to run it on startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Create a Batch File\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **Notepad** and create a batch file (e.g., `mount_s3_drive.bat`) with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   cd \"C:\\rclone\"\n",
    "   rclone mount arkalivr:arkalivr X: --vfs-cache-mode full --dir-cache-time 12h --vfs-cache-max-age 12h --poll-interval 10m --vfs-read-chunk-size 64M --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 1G --log-file=rclone_mount.log --log-level DEBUG\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `timeout /t 15` adds a 15-second delay to ensure the network initializes.\n",
    "   - Save this file as `mount_s3_drive.bat` in a reliable location like `C:\\Scripts`.\n",
    "   - **Everytime when you log in jut run the .bat file to mount the drive automatically**\n",
    "\n"
   ]

    "## Updated Mount Command for Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `--daemon` and `--idle-timeout` flags are not supported on Windows, use the following command to mount the S3 bucket with adjusted cache settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "rclone mount arkalivr:arkalivr X: --vfs-cache-mode full --dir-cache-time 12h --vfs-cache-max-age 12h --poll-interval 10m --vfs-read-chunk-size 64M --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 1G --log-file=rclone_mount.log --log-level DEBUG\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **--vfs-cache-mode full**: Enables full caching for better stability.\n",
    "- **--dir-cache-time 12h**: Keeps directory listings in cache for 12 hours.\n",
    "- **--vfs-cache-max-age 12h**: Keeps cached files for 12 hours.\n",
    "- **--poll-interval 10m**: Checks for changes every 10 minutes.\n",
    "- **--vfs-read-chunk-size 64M** and **--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 1G**: Configures chunk sizes for better performance on large files.\n",
    "- **--log-file=rclone_mount.log --log-level DEBUG**: Logs output to a file for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should provide a stable mount for the S3 bucket on Windows, allowing the drive to persist after reboots and during inactivity periods.\n"
