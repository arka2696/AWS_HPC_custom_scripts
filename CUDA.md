# Installing NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit on Ubuntu 22.04

This guide walks you through installing the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit using `.deb` packages on Ubuntu 22.04. It includes steps to fix common issues like the `Signed-By` conflict and to verify a successful installation.

---

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- NVIDIA GPU installed
- NVIDIA driver installed (run `nvidia-smi` to check)

---

## Step 1: Download the CUDA Keyring `.deb`

Download the official keyring package from NVIDIA:

```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
````

Install the keyring:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
```

---

## Step 2: Fix Signed-By Conflict (if it occurs)

If you encounter this error:

```text
E: Conflicting values set for option Signed-By regarding source https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/ /: ...
```

### ðŸ›  Solution:

Edit the CUDA source list:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda.list
```

Replace any existing line with the following **correct format**:

```text
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg] https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/ /
```

Save (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`) and exit (`Ctrl+X`).

---

## Step 3: Update Package List

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

This should now work without any errors.

---

## Step 4: Install the CUDA Toolkit

To install the full toolkit:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cuda
```

You can also install specific versions, like:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install cuda-12-3
```

Check available versions:

```bash
apt-cache search cuda-toolkit
```

---

## Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables

Add the following lines to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Then apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Step 6: Verify the Installation

### Check CUDA Toolkit version:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

### Check GPU status:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

---

## Optional: Clean Up

Remove the downloaded `.deb` file if no longer needed:

```bash
rm cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
```
